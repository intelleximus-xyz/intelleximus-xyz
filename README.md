## About Me

I studied medicine in Monterrey and Reynosa, where I spent a year on clinical clerkships at a hospital. During my medical training, I conducted research on the correlations between electromagnetic frequencies and other factors, though this work has not yet been published.

After obtaining my medical degree, I worked as a clinical doctor of initial attention and completed postgraduate training. Subsequently, I spent half a year on a cruise ship following my completion of proportionality correction for age-related tissue atrophy. I also earned a certificate diploma from the University of Guadalajara in the beautiful city of Guadalajara.

In addition to my clinical practice, I provide part-time support to a school as a school doctor and explore occupational health as part of the Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) framework, where I serve as the Director of Medical Plant in both luxury car assembly plants. I also traveled to Cuba to pursue an epidemiology and hygiene specialty.

Currently, I am a student of computer science and concurrently pursuing a law degree at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). Through my studies and professional experience, I have become aware of the root causes of many contemporary challenges. I have observed that these fundamental issues often go unaddressed, possibly because they are not recognized as stemming from the foundational Greek philosophical developments. These ancient frameworks demonstrated that freedom is not found in unrestricted action, but through rigorous examination of potential biases and the proper realization of human values.

However, there appears to be a gap in the genuine understanding of these values. It is insufficient to merely assert the importance of ethics; rather, their principles must be presented and applied effectively. In the current context, this intellectual exercise should naturally illuminate the significance of human values, as they are already intrinsically connected to our cognitive processes, communications, and written expressions.

Consequently, I founded Humanorum, a non-profit corporation, where I currently dedicate my efforts. Additionally, I maintain documentation and technical work on cloud platforms including OpenAuth, Cloudflare, and Azure static websites. My technical interests include blockchain development, Python programming, and assembly code, with direct management of system-level operations.
