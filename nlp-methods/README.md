# Natural Language Processing Methods: A Chronological Overview

This directory contains a comprehensive breakdown of known methods for approaching Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each technique is organized chronologically from the oldest to the newest approaches, with the goal of understanding the fundamental concepts rather than simply imitating implementations.

## Directory Structure

Each numbered folder represents a major approach or technique in NLP history:

- **01-rule-based-systems** (1950s-1960s): Early symbolic approaches using hand-crafted rules
- **02-statistical-methods** (1980s-1990s): Probabilistic and statistical modeling techniques
- **03-machine-learning** (1990s-2000s): Traditional machine learning algorithms for NLP
- **04-deep-learning** (2010s): Neural network approaches for NLP tasks
- **05-word-embeddings** (2013-2015): Distributed representations of words
- **06-attention-mechanisms** (2014-2017): Attention and memory mechanisms in neural networks
- **07-transformers** (2017+): Transformer architecture and self-attention
- **08-pre-trained-models** (2018-2020): Transfer learning with large pre-trained models
- **09-large-language-models** (2020+): Massive scale language models (GPT-3, GPT-4, etc.)
- **10-multimodal-approaches** (2021+): Models combining language with vision and other modalities

## Purpose

This collection aims to provide a clear understanding of:

1. **Historical Context**: How NLP methods evolved over time
2. **Core Principles**: The fundamental ideas behind each approach
3. **Strengths and Limitations**: What each method does well and where it falls short
4. **Connections**: How newer methods build upon or diverge from older ones

## Philosophy

The focus here is on **understanding**, not imitation. Each method is presented with:

- Clear explanations of the underlying concepts
- The problems they were designed to solve
- Their contributions to the field
- Their limitations and the motivation for subsequent approaches

This is intended as an educational resource for those who want to truly comprehend the landscape of NLP, rather than just apply existing solutions.
