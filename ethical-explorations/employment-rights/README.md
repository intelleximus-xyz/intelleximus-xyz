2. **Virtue Ethics**: Examining what character traits and practices constitute ethical employment relationships
3. **Consequentialism**: Analyzing the outcomes and impacts of employment practices on all stakeholders
4. **Social Contract Theory**: Understanding implicit and explicit obligations in the employment relationship

## Interconnections

Employment ethics connects with broader themes:

- **Occupational Health**: As explored in the EHS (Environmental Health and Safety) framework
